19779	B003HGKJ2I	Limited ten inch vinyl pressing of this 2010 EP includes a CD copy of the tracks on the album. Inspired by Richard Hawley's recent BBC Radio 2 series The Ocean (wherein he explored how the sea, seafaring culture and sea travel has shaped the music, art and literature of The British Isles), False Lights From The Land features two original Hawley compositions: the lead song, 'Remorse Code'([taken from his critically acclaimed album Truelove's Gutter) and a previously unreleased song, 'The Storm'. Additionally, the EP offers two cover tunes: a haunting rendition of 'The Ellan Vannin Tragedy' (written by Hughie Jones of English Folk legends The Spinners), which tells the tale of a ship that sank in stormy weather off Liverpool Bay in 1909 killing all 36 aboard; and an acappella performance of 'Shallow Brown', a pumping shanty of West Indian origin. Both covers feature guest vocal accompaniment by Smoke Fairies. Mute.	0.0

19772	B003GTZULG	Strawberry Window hailed from the San Francisco Bay Area's East Bay music scene in the mid '60s and were truly one of the 'early birds' and innovators who made their own distinct brand of rock-n-roll. They played in a heavy-psychedelic-garage style, sounding somewhat reminiscent of the Jefferson Airplane, (early) Mad River, Buffalo Springfield, Quicksilver Messenger Service and Frumious Bandersnatch. These previously unreleased recordings have survived for the last four decades in a box on a shelf in a band member's closet. Meticulous care and detail has been taken to master these recordings with a fresh, open approach, while ensuring that the sound and integrity of the vintage songs remained intact. The amazing music of this guitar based quartet ranges from catchy electric folk tunes and 'West Coast' garage rock to raw energetic acid jams lasting over 10 minutes. You'll be impressed by the great stereo sound quality throughout their ten original cuts not to mention their freaky cover version of JD Loudermilk's 'Tobacco Road.' It's an outright shame that this talented bunch were not signed to a record deal back then. Then again, that's okay with us because it has allowed World In Sound the opportunity to proudly present for the first time ever, the music of and the history behind this talented group of songwriters and wild performers known as the Strawberry Window. Contains 65 minutes of intense but melodic performances and also comes with a 16-page color booklet that will take you on a trip back to the halcyon days of the Summer of Love. In 1968, they switched guitar players, added a girl singer and changed their name to the Dandelion Wine. They recorded several songs and also released a private pressing of a 4 song 7 inch EP. Truly a masterpiece!	0.0
