1143	B00004R8UB	"70's inspired melodic grooves over 90's beats. No rappers, no solos, no singers. Put the top down and chill, baby, chill. Multi-instrumentalist Shane 'the doctor' Faber is the man behind the music. Equally at home on either side of the recording console, he writes and produces all of the material. JeepJazz is a combination of programming and live playing, digital and analog recording techniques and Shane's unique sense of melody and composition. It all comes together on this followup to the original JeepJazz Project CD, ""Digital Flavor on the Sonic Frontier"", released in 1997. Music from this new CD has already been tapped for the soon to be released films, ""Advice From A Caterpiller"" and ""I'll Take You There"". Band Members: Shane Faber, De Harris"	0.010050251256281407
